# Solar Sense

Solar Sense is a web-based Smart Solar System SaaS platform designed to automate and optimize operations in the solar energy domain.

## Features

1. **Rooftop Analysis**: Utilizes Google Maps API to provide insights on power generation potential and total cost of ownership based on the user's region of interest.

2. **Solar Power Generation Forecasting**: Implements a short-term forecasting system using an LSTM-based predictive model. The model is trained on historical data and weather parameters such as solar irradiance and cloud cover.

3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Analyzes defects and faults in PV panels to enable proactive maintenance. Specifically, it detects soiling and hotspot formations on PV panels using a VGG-UNET architecture.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: React JS
- Backend: Flask
- Deep learning - Tensorflow, PyTorch
- Machine learning - Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn

# Getting started with Flask App

### 'cd src/python/'

### 'python app.py'

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
